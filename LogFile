Changes:  Created prefabs for the stage and put them in the prefabs folder. The prefabs allow the sprites to snap to an adjustable grid. Also created the playfield object and set the border for our game's stage.

Changes:  Created a prefab for the player, granting up/down/left/right movement. The Sprite is animated and reflects about the Y axis when horizontal input direction changes.
